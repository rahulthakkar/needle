Needle stands for necessary elements of deep learning. Itâ€™s a minimalist PyTorch-like library with a comprehensive bells and whistles of standard deep learning frameworks. It was developed over the course of the [10-414/714: Deep Learning Systems](https://dlsyscourse.org/) class. It includes reverse automatic differentiation engine, elements of simple neural network library like common neural networks  modules, optimization techniques, options for data loading etc. Initially NumPy was used as the backend, but in the later part of the course this was replaced with the manually written linear algebra routines for CPU and GPU devices (only CUDA).
